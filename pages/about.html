    <!-- Our Story Section -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>üìñ Our Story</h2>
        <p>TutorMatch started with a small idea, helping students feel less stressed and more confident with their learning. A few of us, who were tutors ourselves, kept seeing how many students were falling behind not because they weren‚Äôt smart, but because they just needed someone to explain things in a way that made sense to them. So, we decided to build a place where students could easily find a tutor who really got them.</p>
        <p>Since then, TutorMatch has grown into a friendly and supportive platform that connects great tutors with learners of all ages. We care about more than just test scores, we want to help students feel good about learning and believe in themselves. Whether it's maths, English, or anything in between, we‚Äôre here to make the learning journey a little easier, and a lot more encouraging.</p>

    <!-- Our Future Strategy Section -->
    <section class="about-section">
        <h2>üå±Our Future Strategy</h2>
        <p>At TutorMatch, we're always looking ahead. In the coming years, we plan to grow our tutor network across more subjects and languages, so every student can find the right help no matter what they're learning. We also want to make our website even easier to use, with new tools that let students track their progress and set learning goals.        </p>
        <p>We're also exploring ways to bring tutoring to more communities, including those who may not have easy access to learning support. Our goal is to make quality tutoring affordable and available to everyone. As we grow, we‚Äôll keep listening to our students, parents, and tutors, because your feedback shapes everything we do.        </p>
